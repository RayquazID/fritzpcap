# fritzpcap
### make a packet capture on the whole lan traffic and create a datastream.pcap



at the moment, this is just for my personal use and pretty raw
you have to define sone default variables befor use
i'll make an interactive way to input this soon
other planned impovements:
 - list all possible interfaces to capture on
 - select interface to capture
 - some cool swag and colors
if someone has suggestions on making this little project better, let me know

Usage
```bash
./fritzpcap.py <TIME TO CAPTURE IN SECONDS>
```
